A simple responsive 404 page built using HTML and CSS using mainly flexbox and grid

- You can see the demo [here](https://keen-kirch-58a2e0.netlify.app/)
- This first turned out to be a little bit confusing at first but as I started going deeper I started understanding the concept and how to go about it.
- This helped improved my CSS skills a bit. My main issue was responsive development and this helped a bit understand more about how it works
- If you're a beginner, you need to checkout and practice these challenges as they'll help improve your web development skills a lot.
